    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Combine shrimp, olive oil, red pepper flakes, salt, and Aleppo pepper flakes in a bowl;
                toss to coat shrimp completely in oil and spices.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Heat a large skillet over high heat until very hot. Cook shrimp in a single layer
                until browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Turn shrimp and cook until browned
                on the other side, about 1 minute more. Transfer shrimp to a bowl.
            </p>
        </li>

                Heat the same skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion with a pinch of salt in hot skillet until
                onions are slightly golden and just becoming translucent; 2 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and oregano to
                onion; cook and stir until fragrant, 15 to 30 seconds.
            </p>

                Pour white wine into onions and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the
                bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon; add crushed tomatoes and lower heat to medium-low. Cook and stir
                until tomato mixture thickens and flavors blend, 10 to 15 minutes.
            </p>

                Return shrimp to skillet along with any accumulated juices in the bowl. Cook until shrimp are reheated,
                2 to 4 minutes. Stir parsley and basil into sauce and season with salt, red pepper flakes, and Aleppo
                pepper flakes.
